### Credit
Credit is where credit's due: This admin template is inspired by the great [AdminLTE](https://adminlte.io/), which is why you might encounter similarity in terms of scope, but we do write all our own components and don't use any of AdminLTEs code. AdminLTE is also based on Bootstrap 3 and therefore created with LESS instead of SASS, which is our "go to" css preprocessor. We also try to go for a more minimal, clean and modern design.
